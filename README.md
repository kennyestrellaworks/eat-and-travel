This is a project I did last year after I finished a course in Udemy, **Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! by Jonas Schmedtmann**. I would recommened that course for someone who wants to learn Web Development, the explanations are well presented and the teacher is very good.

- Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
- Advanced responsive design: media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first and em vs rem units
- SVG images in HTML and CSS
- Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads
