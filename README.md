This is a project I did last year (2020) after I finished a course in Udemy, Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! by Jonas Schmedtmann. I would recommened that course for someone who wants to learn Web Development, the explanations are well presented and the teacher is very good.
